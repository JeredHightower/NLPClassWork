There’s no other word for it: The Incredibles did incredibly, with an estimated $70.7 million opening weekend box office that puts the new Disney-Pixar release ahead of the $70.3 million first reeled in by the same studios’ Finding Nemo and behind only rival DreamWorks’ Shrek 2, which premiered to a record debut of $108 million.

The Incredibles, a stunt-heavy action adventure about a family of forcibly retired superheroes with an itch to get back in the game, was praised by critics and features the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee.

Director Taylor Hackford’s biopic Ray – which looks to be assuring leading man Jamie Foxx as late music legend Ray Charles of at least an Oscar nomination – remained a respectable No. 2 for a second straight weekend.

But another high-profile new release opened weakly: Alfie with Jude Law as a notoriously unrepentant womanizer, which came in fifth place with $6.5 million. On safer ground, the horror hit The Grudge, with Sarah Michelle Gellar, which had been No. 1 the past two weekends, slipped to third place this week, but still has earned an impressive $89.6 million so far.
