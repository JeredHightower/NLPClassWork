Superhero films and TV shows are very common these days, but, back in 2004 when the first The Incredibles movie came out, they weren't such a staple of cinematography just yet.
Despite that—or maybe because of it—the animated film that offered a new view of superheroes turned out to be a hit.Thousands of fans the adventures of the Parr superhero family, and they were excited when the first film's sequel came out three years ago.
Despite the franchise's popularity, though, there are plenty of intriguing details that not every person who saw the films might know about.Every superhero movie needs a proper villain.
In this case, The Incredibles support the notion that heroes create their own enemies.
Mr. Incredible's arch-enemy turns out to be Syndrome, the boy Buddy who once wanted to be his sidekick.
Mr. Incredible rejected him, breaking his heart in the process and making him an enemy for life.However, what not all viewers might realize is that Syndrome wasn't originally supposed to be the main villain.
The plan was for him to appear only in the opening scene, but, since the Pixar animators liked him so much, they gave him a much larger part.The Incredibles is an original superhero franchise that doesn't belong to any major superhero universe, but fans who don't like to read comics might fail to realize the superhero family is inspired by other, even better-known heroes.
The most obvious example is the Fantastic Four, another family with eerily similar powers.Reed Richards, A.K.A.
Mr. Fantastic, can stretch his body like Helen/Elastigirl, and Susan Storm, A.K.A.
The Invisible Woman, can turn invisible and also protect others, just like Violet.
Mr. Incredible then her super strength like another member of the Fantastic Four, the Thing.
Also, DC Comics has a superheroine Elasti-Girl, who can alter the size of her body.Art imitates life, as the saying goes, and that was the case for this story, as director Brad Bird drew inspiration from his life.
Just like many movies, it took quite some time to make The Incredibles, but Bird came up with the story in the early 1990s as he too struggled with balancing his personal life and work life.
As all fans of the franchise will know, this theme plays a major role in the film.What's more, the youngest member of the Parr family, Jack-Jack, doesn't have this name by accident; Brad Bird and his wife gave this nickname to one of their sons.Just like with any film, casting choices were important for The Incredibles.
Bob Parr's best friend, Lucius Best aka Frozone, was voiced by none other than the legendary Samuel L. Jackson.
Jackson has a rich experience with superhero roles since he portrays Nick Fury in the MCU.He got the part of Frozone because Brad Bird wanted Frozone to have the coolest voice of them all.
Judging by Samuel L. Jackson's long list of roles, he seems to exude a sense of coolness.The Incredibles was unique in multiple ways, and one of them was the fact that it was only the second Pixar movie that showed the characters getting injured and actually bleeding.
When Bob attacked the huge robot he was supposed to defeat, he got cut and bled.
The first Pixar movie that was brave enough to show its heroes bleeding was, surprisingly, Finding Nemo (2003).Speaking of the way the film was unique to others of its era, it earned many other firsts the viewers might not know of.
For example, it was the first Pixar movie that had its title appear at the very end.
It was also the first film from Pixar that had a human protagonist.It was Pixar's only PG-rated film that was released on VHS, it was Samuel L. Jackson's first animated acting part, and, finally, on a sadder note, it was also the first Pixar film that didn't even get an Oscar nomination for its music.Fans who loved the first movie eagerly anticipated its sequel.
Yet, it took Incredibles 2 (2018) fourteen years to arrive.
One of the reasons was that Brad Bird was determined to write and direct a sequel to the first story only if he came up with an idea for the plot that would be just as good or even better than in the first film.Also, from a practical point of view, animating the story and recording the voice-over performances can take up a long time.
For example, in the first film, it took Craig T. Nelson two years to record all the lines for Mr. Incredible.Sometimes it's intriguing to imagine what could have been.
One of persisting rumors about the second film is that the character of Voyd is based on Kristen Stewart, with many fans noticing that the character had a similar mannerisms and a comparable apperance.So, even though Voyd was voiced by Sophia Bush, this rumor continues to circle around and cause fans to wonder what the movie would have been like if Kristen Stewart had voiced Voyd instead.Numbers are rarely as exciting as the film's plot and everything surrounding it, but the fans of the Parr family will be pleased to hear their second film broke records, profit-wise.
Incredibles 2 were only the third Pixar movie that earned over one billion dollars worldwide.
As such, it followed in the footsteps of Toy Story 3 (2010) and Finding Dory (2016).Finally, an interesting detail is that the fans who know the comics, more precisely, the comics about Fantastic Four, could guess in advance what powers little Jack-Jack would have.Since the remaining members of his family all have powers inspired by the Fantastic Four, the only one missing was Human Torch who has fire powers—and so does Jack (among many others).
