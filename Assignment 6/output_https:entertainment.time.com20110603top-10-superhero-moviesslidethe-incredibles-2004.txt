A suburban satire, a family comedy, a superhero flick and a thrilling action film — The Incredibles does many things, and it does them all near perfectly.
It feels more real than every other superhero movie, is more exciting than every other superhero movie, is more fun to look at, listen to and experience than every other superhero movie.
With no need to slavishly follow the timelines and storylines and familylines and universelines of Marvel and DC characters, the magicians at Pixar were able to conjure up a set of characters both archetypal and unique.
It’s the perfect superhero film.
