If you haven't watched the movie in a while, you may think the Pixar classic takes place in the early 2000s, when it came out. After all, Mr. Incredible works on a computer and there are some high-tech gadgets used in the film.One small moment early on in the movie will tell you the movie actually takes place in the '60s. Early in the movie as the Parr family attempts to eat dinner, Bob/Mr. Incredible sneaks off to read the news. Those are just a few examples. Director Brad Bird has said that the comic books and spy movies he grew up with in the '60s inspired the film, so it would make sense for him to pay tribute to the past while bringing it into the present.
