# What this Program Does
This program takes a csv file with the following parameters [Last,First,Middle Initial,ID,Office phone].
It capitalizes first names, last names, and middle initial. If no middle intial is provided it is replaced with an X.
This program also verifies that ID and Phone numbers are correctly formatted and prompts for user input if not.

After all data is verified, information is placed in a Person object for each employee and all Persons are placed in a dictionary

This data is then written to a pickle file and read back out to print a list of the employees with the updated information.

# Strengths/Weaknesses of Python for text processing
One major advantage Python has is that since it's so easy to write, doing any coding for text processing is relatively
quicker to get running. Although some of it is cumbersome it's not as bad as it could be.

However, since Python isn't strongly typed, this could potentially lead to some issues if you overlook a detail and the code
still works for whatever reason. And on a much larger scale, if you are using Python exclusively, it would be quite slow.


# What I Learned and Reviewed
It's been a little bit since I used Python, but since I'm familiar with it most everything is review.
Defining classes, methods, methods for strings, and methods for dictonaries was all stuff I needed to review.
Pickling I haven't done in a while, but have done in the past.
The only thing I wasn't familiar with was using regex with Python. That was relatively new, but regex is still cumbersome
as it is in other languages.
